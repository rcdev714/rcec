# Google Gemini API Quota Issue - Solution Guide

## Problem Identified ✅
Your production issue was caused by **exceeding the Google Gemini API quota limit**:
- **Free tier limit**: 50 requests per day for `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **Error 429**: Too Many Requests
- This explains why it works sometimes in localhost but fails in production

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Switch to Higher-Limit Model (Recommended)
I've already updated the code to use `gemini-1.5-flash` which has higher rate limits.

Add this to your `.env.local` file:
```bash
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

**Rate Limits for Different Models:**
- `gemini-1.5-flash`: 1,500 requests per day (FREE)
- `gemini-1.5-pro`: 50 requests per day (FREE)
- `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`: 50 requests per day (FREE) ⚠️ Current issue

### Option 2: Upgrade to Paid Plan
Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/pricing) to upgrade:
- **Pay-as-you-go**: $0.075 per 1M input tokens
- **No daily limits** with paid plans
- Much more reliable for production

### Option 3: Use Multiple API Keys (Rotation)
For development/testing, you could rotate between multiple free API keys:
```bash
# In .env.local, you could alternate these
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-primary-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY_BACKUP=your-backup-key
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Update Your Environment
Add to `.env.local`:
```bash
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

### 2. Test Locally
```bash
cd rcec
node scripts/test-env.js
npm run dev
```

### 3. Deploy to Production
Make sure to set `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash` in your production environment variables.

## Long-term Recommendations

### For Production Use:
1. **Upgrade to paid plan** - Most reliable solution
2. **Implement rate limiting** - Protect against quota exhaustion
3. **Add usage monitoring** - Track API usage
4. **Consider caching** - Cache responses to reduce API calls

### Current Fix Applied:
✅ Better error messages for quota issues  
✅ Switched to `gemini-1.5-flash` (1,500 requests/day vs 50)  
✅ Configurable model via environment variable  
✅ Improved error handling and logging  

## Testing the Fix

1. Wait for your quota to reset (next day) OR upgrade to paid plan
2. Set `GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash` in your environment
3. Deploy and test

Your app should now work much more reliably with the 1,500 daily requests limit instead of 50!
